After you complete Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) installation, review the following tasks, many of which are required before you can successfully deploy and manage applications, register APIs, and use API Exchange on an Anypoint Platform PCE environment running on your own local network.

* Close port 61009 in the cluster security group. If you are using AWS, you can use the AWS Web console to do this.

Processes that serve external traffic do not run as root, to maximize security.
