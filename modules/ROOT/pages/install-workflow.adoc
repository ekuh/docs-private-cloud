After your infrastructure team verifies that the required infrastructure is correctly installed and configured as described in xref:install-checklist.adoc[Product Prerequisites], you can install Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) using one of the following installers: 

* xref:install-installer.adoc[Run the GUI installer]
* xref:install-auto-install.adoc[Run the CLI installer]

[WARNING]
You must contact MuleSoft Professional Services prior to installation. MuleSoft professional services must be involved with your installation procedure.

The GUI installer is interactive and walks you through a set of wizard pages that enable you to specify configuration options, but it also requires you to open extra ports and a web browser to access the pages.

The CLI installer does not require human interaction using a web browser and is useful for automation.
