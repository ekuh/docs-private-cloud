Before an Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE) upgrade is performed, you must verify that your working installation meets any additional requirements of the new Anypoint Platform PCE version, such as opening additional ports or adding a new port for the load balancer.

Refer to the xref:release-notes::pce/anypoint-private-cloud-release-notes.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Release Notes] for additional information about the most recent Anypoint Platform PCE version.
